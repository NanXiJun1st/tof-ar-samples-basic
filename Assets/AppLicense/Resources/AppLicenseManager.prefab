    For the purposes\r\n      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include

    \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\r\n      the original
    version of the Work and any modifications or additions\r\n      to that Work

    for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\r\n      or by an individual

    of\r\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\r\n

    license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\r\n      publicly display,

    Works in Source or Object form.\r\n\r\n   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject
    to the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, each Contributor hereby

    irrevocable\r\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make,
    have made,\r\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
    the Work,\r\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\r\n     
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\r\n      Contribution(s)
    alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\r\n      with the Work to which
    such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\r\n      institute patent litigation
    against any entity (including a\r\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
    alleging that the Work\r\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
    constitutes direct\r\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
    licenses\r\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\r\n     
    as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n   4. Redistribution. You may
    reproduce and distribute copies of the\r\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof
    in any medium, with or without\r\n      modifications, and in Source or Object
    form, provided that You\r\n      meet the following conditions:\r\n\r\n     
    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\r\n          Derivative
    Works a copy of this License; and\r\n\r\n      (b) You must cause any modified
    files to carry prominent notices\r\n          stating that You changed the files;
    and\r\n\r\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\r\n         
    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\r\n          attribution
    notices from the Source form of the Work,\r\n          excluding those notices
    that do not pertain to any part of\r\n          the Derivative Works; and\r\n\r\n     
    (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\r\n          distribution,
    then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\r\n          include a readable
    copy of the attribution notices contained\r\n          within such NOTICE file,
    excluding those notices that do not\r\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative
    Works, in at least one\r\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE
    text file distributed\r\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the
    Source form or\r\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
    Works; or,\r\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if
    and\r\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\r\n         
    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\r\n          do not
    modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\r\n          notices within
    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\r\n          or as an addendum
    to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\r\n          that such additional
    attribution notices cannot be construed\r\n          as modifying the License.\r\n\r\n     
    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\r\n      may
    provide additional or different license terms and conditions\r\n      for use,
    reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\r\n      for any such
    Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\r\n      reproduction, and distribution
    of the Work otherwise complies with\r\n      the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n  
    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\r\n     
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\r\n      by
    You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n      this
    License, without any additional terms or conditions.\r\n      Notwithstanding
    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\r\n      the terms of any
    separate license agreement you may have executed\r\n      with Licensor regarding
    such Contributions.\r\n\r\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
    to use the trade\r\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names
    of the Licensor,\r\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use
    in describing the\r\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
    the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
    law or\r\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\r\n     
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n      WITHOUT
    WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\r\n      implied, including,
    without limitation, any warranties or conditions\r\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
    MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\r\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
    responsible for determining the\r\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing
    the Work and assume any\r\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
    under this License.\r\n\r\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
    no legal theory,\r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
    otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
    grossly\r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
    be\r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n     
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\r\n      result
    of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\r\n      Work (including
    but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\r\n      work stoppage, computer
    failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\n      other commercial damages or losses),
    even if such Contributor\r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such
    damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n     
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge
    a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability
    obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License. However, in
    accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n      on Your own behalf and
    on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n      of any other Contributor,
    and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n      defend, and hold each Contributor
    harmless for any liability\r\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against,
    such Contributor by reason\r\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional
    liability.\r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n   APPENDIX: How to apply
    the Apache License to your work.\r\n\r\n      To apply the Apache License to
    your work, attach the following\r\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields

    or attached to the work\r\n      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\r\n\r\n     
    \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\r\n     
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\r\n     
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\r\n     
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\r\n     
    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\r\n     
    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\r\n     
    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\r\n\r\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean
    any work of authorship, including\r\n      the original version of the Work and
    any modifications or additions\r\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof,
    that is intentionally\r\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work
    by the copyright owner\r\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized
    to submit on behalf of\r\n      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this
    definition, \"submitted\"\r\n      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
    communication sent\r\n      to the Licensor or its representatives, including
    but not limited to\r\n      communication on electronic mailing lists, source
    code control systems,\r\n      and issue tracking systems that are managed by,
    or on behalf of, the\r\n      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving
    the Work, but\r\n      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or
    otherwise\r\n      designated in writing by the copyright owner as \"Not a Contribution.\"\r\n\r\n     
    \"Contributor\" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\r\n     
    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\r\n      subsequently
    incorporated within the Work.\r\n\r\n   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject
    to the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, each Contributor hereby
    grants to You a perpetual,\r\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
    irrevocable\r\n      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works
    of,\r\n      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\r\n     
    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\r\n\r\n   3. Grant of
    Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License,
    each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\r\n      worldwide, non-exclusive,
    no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\r\n      (except as stated in this section)
    patent license to make, have made,\r\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import,
    and otherwise transfer the Work,\r\n      where such license applies only to
    those patent claims licensable\r\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily
    infringed by their\r\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
    Contribution(s)\r\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
    If You\r\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\r\n     
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\r\n      or
    a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\r\n      or contributory
    patent infringement, then any patent licenses\r\n      granted to You under this
    License for that Work shall terminate\r\n      as of the date such litigation
    is filed.\r\n\r\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies
    of the\r\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\r\n     
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\r\n      meet
    the following conditions:\r\n\r\n      (a) You must give any other recipients
    of the Work or\r\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\r\n\r\n     
    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\r\n         
    stating that You changed the files; and\r\n\r\n      (c) You must retain, in
    the Source form of any Derivative Works\r\n          that You distribute, all
    copyright, patent, trademark, and\r\n          attribution notices from the Source
    form of the Work,\r\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to
    any part of\r\n          the Derivative Works; and\r\n\r\n      (d) If the Work
    includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\r\n          distribution, then
    any Derivative Works that You distribute must\r\n          include a readable
    copy of the attribution notices contained\r\n          within such NOTICE file,
    excluding those notices that do not\r\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative
    Works, in at least one\r\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE
    text file distributed\r\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the
    Source form or\r\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
    Works; or,\r\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if
    and\r\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\r\n         
    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\r\n          do not
    modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\r\n          notices within
    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\r\n          or as an addendum
    to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\r\n          that such additional
    attribution notices cannot be construed\r\n          as modifying the License.\r\n\r\n     
    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\r\n      may
    provide additional or different license terms and conditions\r\n      for use,
    reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\r\n      for any such
    Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\r\n      reproduction, and distribution
    of the Work otherwise complies with\r\n      the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n  
    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\r\n     
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\r\n      by
    You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n      this
    License, without any additional terms or conditions.\r\n      Notwithstanding
    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\r\n      the terms of any
    separate license agreement you may have executed\r\n      with Licensor regarding
    such Contributions.\r\n\r\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
    to use the trade\r\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names
    of the Licensor,\r\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use
    in describing the\r\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
    the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
    law or\r\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\r\n     
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n      WITHOUT
    WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\r\n      implied, including,
    without limitation, any warranties or conditions\r\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
    MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\r\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
    responsible for determining the\r\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing
    the Work and assume any\r\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
    under this License.\r\n\r\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
    no legal theory,\r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
    otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
    grossly\r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
    be\r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n     
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\r\n      result
    of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\r\n      Work (including
    but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\r\n      work stoppage, computer
    failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\n      other commercial damages or losses),
    even if such Contributor\r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such
    damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n     
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge
    a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability
    obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License. However, in
    accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n      on Your own behalf and
    on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n      of any other Contributor,
    and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n      defend, and hold each Contributor
    harmless for any liability\r\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against,
    such Contributor by reason\r\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional
    liability.\r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n   APPENDIX: How to apply
    the Apache License to your work.\r\n\r\n      To apply the Apache License to

    For the purposes\r\n      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include

    \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\r\n      the original

    of\r\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\r\n

    license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\r\n      publicly display,
    publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\r\n      Work and such Derivative
    Works in Source or Object form.\r\n\r\n   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject
    to the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, each Contributor hereby
    grants to You a perpetual,\r\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
    irrevocable\r\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make,
    have made,\r\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
    the Work,\r\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\r\n     
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\r\n      Contribution(s)
    alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\r\n      with the Work to which
    such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\r\n      institute patent litigation
    against any entity (including a\r\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
    alleging that the Work\r\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
    constitutes direct\r\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
    licenses\r\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\r\n     
    as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n   4. Redistribution. You may
    reproduce and distribute copies of the\r\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof
    in any medium, with or without\r\n      modifications, and in Source or Object
    form, provided that You\r\n      meet the following conditions:\r\n\r\n     
    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\r\n          Derivative
    Works a copy of this License; and\r\n\r\n      (b) You must cause any modified
    files to carry prominent notices\r\n          stating that You changed the files;
    and\r\n\r\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\r\n         
    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\r\n          attribution
    notices from the Source form of the Work,\r\n          excluding those notices
    that do not pertain to any part of\r\n          the Derivative Works; and\r\n\r\n     
    (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\r\n          distribution,
    then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\r\n          include a readable
    copy of the attribution notices contained\r\n          within such NOTICE file,
    excluding those notices that do not\r\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative
    Works, in at least one\r\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE
    text file distributed\r\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the
    Source form or\r\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
    Works; or,\r\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if
    and\r\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\r\n         
    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\r\n          do not
    modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\r\n          notices within
    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\r\n          or as an addendum
    to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\r\n          that such additional
    attribution notices cannot be construed\r\n          as modifying the License.\r\n\r\n     
    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\r\n      may
    provide additional or different license terms and conditions\r\n      for use,
    reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\r\n      for any such
    Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\r\n      reproduction, and distribution
    of the Work otherwise complies with\r\n      the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n  
    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\r\n     
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\r\n      by
    You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n      this
    License, without any additional terms or conditions.\r\n      Notwithstanding
    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\r\n      the terms of any
    separate license agreement you may have executed\r\n      with Licensor regarding
    such Contributions.\r\n\r\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
    to use the trade\r\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names
    of the Licensor,\r\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use
    in describing the\r\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
    the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
    law or\r\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\r\n     
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n      WITHOUT
    WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\r\n      implied, including,
    without limitation, any warranties or conditions\r\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
    MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\r\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
    responsible for determining the\r\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing
    the Work and assume any\r\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
    under this License.\r\n\r\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
    no legal theory,\r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
    otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and

    or otherwise. Such updates or modifications may delete or change the nature of
    features or other aspects of the SOFTWARE, including, but not limited to, functions
    you may rely upon. You acknowledge and agree that such activities may occur at
    SONY\u2019s sole discretion and that SONY may condition continued use of the
    SOFTWARE upon your complete installation or acceptance of such update or modifications.
    Any updates/modifications shall be deemed to be, and shall constitute part of,

    EULA (and SONY\u2019s applicable privacy policy separately presented to you,
    if any), as amended and modified from time to time, constitute the entire agreement(s)
    between you and SONY with respect to the SOFTWARE. The failure of SONY to exercise
    or enforce any right or provision of this EULA shall not constitute a waiver
    of such right or provision. If any part of this EULA is held invalid, illegal,
    or unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible
    so as to maintain the intent of this EULA, and the other parts will remain in
    full force and effect. \r\n\r\nGOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION\r\nThe United Nations
    Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to
    this EULA. This EULA shall be governed by the laws of Japan, without regards
    to conflict of laws provisions. Any dispute arising out of this EULA shall be

    parties hereby consent to the venue and jurisdiction of such courts. The foregoing
    does not apply to you to the extent applicable law of your jurisdiction restricts
    or prohibits such agreements.\r\n\r\nEQUITABLE REMEDIES\r\nNotwithstanding anything
    contained in this EULA to the contrary, you acknowledge and agree that any violation
    of or non-compliance with this EULA by you will cause irreparable harm to SONY,
    for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and you consent to SONY obtaining
    any injunctive or equitable relief that SONY deems necessary or appropriate in
    such circumstances. SONY may also take any legal and technical remedies to prevent
    violation of and/or to enforce this EULA, including, but not limited to, immediate
    termination of your use of the SOFTWARE, if SONY believes in its sole discretion
    that you are violating or intend to violate this EULA. These remedies are in
    addition to any other remedies SONY may have at law, in equity or under contract.\r\n\r\nTERMINATION\r\nWithout
    prejudice to any of its other rights, SONY may terminate this EULA if you fail
    to comply with any of its terms. In case of such termination, you must: (i) cease
    all use, and destroy any copies, of the SOFTWARE; (ii) comply with the requirements
    in the section below entitled \u201CYour Account Responsibilities\u201D.\r\n\r\nAMENDMENT\r\nSONY
    RESERVES THE RIGHT TO AMEND ANY OF THE TERMS OF THIS EULA AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION
    BY POSTING NOTICE ON A SONY DESIGNATED WEB SITE, BY EMAIL NOTIFICATION TO AN
    EMAIL ADDRESS PROVIDED BY YOU, BY PROVIDING NOTICE AS PART OF THE PROCESS IN
    WHICH YOU OBTAIN UPGRADES/UPDATES OR BY ANY OTHER LEGALLY RECOGNIZABLE FORM OF
    NOTICE. If you do not agree to the amendment, you should promptly contact SONY
    for instructions. Your continued use of the SOFTWARE after the effective date
    of any such notice shall be deemed your agreement to be bound by such amendment.
    \r\n\r\nTHIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES\r\nEach THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIER is an express
    intended third-party beneficiary of, and shall have the right to enforce, each
    provision of this EULA with respect to the software of such party.\r\n\r\nYOUR
    ACCOUNT RESPONSIBILITIES\r\nShould you return your DEVICE to its place of purchase,
    sell or otherwise transfer your DEVICE, or if this EULA is terminated, you are
    responsible for and must, if reasonably possible, uninstall the SOFTWARE from
    the DEVICE and delete any and all accounts you may have established on DEVICE
    or are accessible through the SOFTWARE. You are solely responsible for maintaining
    the confidentiality of any accounts you have with SONY or third parties and any
    usernames and passwords associated with your use of the DEVICE.\r\n\r\nShould
    you have any questions concerning this EULA, you may contact SONY by writing
    to SONY at the applicable contact address for each area or country.\r\n\r\n"
